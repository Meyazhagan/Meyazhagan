## CHIP 8 EMULATOR
• Implemented pseudo operation for each opcode.
• It emulate architecture of chip 8 to run .c8 file.
### From this project I
• Learn to implement bitwise operator.
• Got great understanding of how an complied program is executed.
• Understood how an emulator is build.

## BASIC 3D RENDER ENGINE USING SWING
• Implemented depth buffer algorithms to get 3D
view.
• Implemented rotation, scaling and shading of triangles.
### From this project I
• Learn to implement rotation, scaling in matrix
representation.
• Learn how to implement matrix multiplication and transpose.
• Calculated surface normal using vector cross product.
• Using normal implemented shading of triangle.

## SUDOKU SOLVER
• Sudoku problem is visualized to solve it.
• Program will fill valid output, if there is any invalid output, it will back track and correct the mistake.
• The program will also allow the player to play.
• It will also evaluate user input.
### From this project I
• Understood of back tracking algorithm.
• Understood of layouts and designing in swing.

## FINDING SHORTEST DISTANCE
• We can set start and destination to find routes.
• We can also draw wall to ignore that way.
### From this project I
• Using A* searching algorithm to find shortest distance.
• Learn about back tracking algorithm.
• Learn to visualize an algorithm.
• Understood of working of finding routes in map.
