# Java Project
- [Chip 8 Emulator](https://github.com/Meyazhagan/chip-8-emulator)
- [Basic 3D Render Engine](https://github.com/Meyazhagan/3d-render-engine)
- [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/Meyazhagan/sudoku-solver)
- [Finding Shortest Distance](https://github.com/Meyazhagan/path-findind)

## CHIP 8 EMULATOR
- Implemented pseudo operation for each opcode.
- It emulate architecture of chip 8 to run .c8 file.
#### From this project I
- Learn to implement bitwise operator.
- Got great understanding of how an complied program is executed.
- Understood how an emulator is build.

## BASIC 3D RENDER ENGINE USING SWING
- Implemented depth buffer algorithms to get 3D view.
- Implemented rotation, scaling and shading of triangles.
#### From this project I
- Learn to implement rotation, scaling in matrix representation.
- Learn how to implement matrix multiplication and transpose.
- Calculated surface normal using vector cross product.
- Using normal implemented shading of triangle.

## SUDOKU SOLVER
- Sudoku problem is visualized to solve it.
- Program will fill valid output, if there is any invalid output, it will back track and correct the mistake.
- The program will also allow the player to play.
- It will also evaluate user input.
#### From this project I
- Understood of back tracking algorithm.
- Understood of layouts and designing in swing.

## FINDING SHORTEST DISTANCE
- We can set start and destination to find routes.
- We can also draw wall to ignore that way.
#### From this project I
- Using A* searching algorithm to find shortest distance.
- Learn about back tracking algorithm.
- Learn to visualize an algorithm.
- Understood of working of finding routes in map.
